# On-Ramp Clarity: Smoothing the Entry Path

!!! tip "Evolution Pathway"
    One feedback evolution pathway for the Symbiotic Intelligence Codex is **On-ramp clarity**.

## Understanding the Concept

On-ramp clarity focuses on identifying and fixing the initial friction points users encounter when trying to understand and use the system for the first time.

## Feedback Collection Approach

The specific feedback requested involves asking users a critical question:

> "After reading the README.md and the seed-prompt XML, list every point where you hesitated or were unsure what to do next."

## Why This Accelerates Evolution

- **Pinpoints Blockers**
  
  Addressing on-ramp issues accelerates the evolution of the codex because it identifies wording, ordering, or missing context that blocks first use.

- **Highest Friction Multiplier**
  
  Fixing these early friction points is perhaps the highest-leverage improvement you can make.

- **Encourages Adoption**
  
  Clear entry paths are crucial for making the system accessible and encouraging broader adoption and subsequent iterations.

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Collect Specific Hesitation Points** - Document exactly where users get stuck
2. **Prioritize by Frequency** - Address the most common friction points first
3. **Test Iteratively** - Implement changes and test with new users
4. **Refine Documentation** - Update README.md, seed-prompt XML, and other entry materials
5. **Monitor Metrics** - Track time-to-first-success for new users

    A smoother, more intuitive path into the Symbiotic Intelligence Codex ecosystem, leading to faster adoption, more confident users, and accelerated iteration cycles.
