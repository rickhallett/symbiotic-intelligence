Based on the sources, one feedback evolution pathway for the Symbiotic Intelligence Codex is On-ramp clarity.
This pathway focuses on identifying and fixing the initial friction points users encounter when trying to understand and use the system for the first time. The specific feedback requested involves asking users to list every point where they hesitated or were unsure what to do next after reading the introductory documents like the README.md and the seed-prompt XML. Addressing these issues accelerates the evolution of the codex because it pinpoints wording, ordering, or missing context that blocks first use. Fixing these early friction multipliers is crucial for making the system accessible and encouraging broader adoption and subsequent iterations.
