# Potential Drawbacks of Frequent AI Use

!!! danger "Cautionary Note"
    Frequent AI use, particularly facilitated by the accelerating Input ⇄ Output loop, presents several potential drawbacks that require careful consideration.

## Overdependence and Erosion of Skills

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- **The Concern**
    
    A primary concern is that constant AI assistance can lead to **cognitive deskilling**. If users frequently turn to AI for hints or solutions, they may practice critical problem-solving skills less often, potentially weakening these abilities over time.

- **The Evidence**
    
    * Studies suggest that students using AI as an aid in programming might show lower self-efficacy, engagement, and performance
    * A strong negative correlation has been found between frequent AI tool use and critical thinking skills
    * Frequent users scored worse on tests of critical analysis and problem-solving

</div>

This phenomenon is described as **cognitive offloading**, where users habituate to offloading mental tasks to AI, which could cause their own capacity for memory, attention, and reasoning to atrophy. This can lead to individuals becoming overly reliant on the technology, hindering their independent problem-solving and critical thinking. Users risk becoming passive consumers of AI outputs, trusting the model over their own judgment.

## Loss of Intuition and "Deep Work"

Constant AI intervention might erode the kind of deep intuition or insight that comes from struggling through problems. The rapid iterative loop can encourage quick fixes and surface-level answers, potentially preventing the "productive frustration" that spurs deeper comprehension.

> "True intuition often comes from effortful practice, which might not develop if the AI always provides the next step."

### Implications:

* If AI can quickly complete tasks like code or essays, users might not grapple with the underlying concepts at a fundamental level
* Relying on AI could short-circuit the learning process
* Students may solve assignments without truly internalizing the knowledge
* Prolonged use without reflection can result in a decline in actual understanding over time

This leads to a legitimate fear of an **"erosion of deep intuition"** that's essential for mastery.

## Bias, Conformity, and Overfitting to AI Outputs

Heavy reliance on a single AI system can narrow a user's perspective because current models have specific styles, knowledge cutoffs, and embedded biases from their training data.

### The Risk of "Overfitting" to AI Outputs:

If users uncritically accept the AI's responses, their thinking might start to align too closely with the AI's worldview, a phenomenon termed "overfitting" to the tool's outputs. This can result in:

1. Propagating the AI's mistakes or biases
2. Adopting suboptimal patterns suggested by the AI
3. Accepting biased information without questioning it
4. Reduced diversity of thought and approach

!!! example "Automation Bias"
    Automation bias can cause people to trust a confident AI answer more than they should, even when it is wrong. The iterative loop risks becoming a self-reinforcing echo chamber if the entire line of reasoning is flawed.

## Impact on Learning Dynamics and Motivation

The ease with which AI can provide quick answers or complete tasks might diminish students' motivation to learn underlying fundamentals. This could foster a mindset of **superficial learning**, focused merely on task completion with AI help, rather than developing resilient understanding.

| Area of Impact | Potential Negative Effect |
| -------------- | ------------------------- |
| Teacher-student interaction | May decrease in an AI-mediated environment |
| Human engagement | Studies note reduced engagement when students rely on ChatGPT |
| Tolerance for ambiguity | Students might become less tolerant of struggle, expecting AI to constantly guide them |
| Discipline mastery | Mental discipline and discovery might be shortchanged by heavy AI use |

The development of expertise requires not just knowing the right answers, but understanding the process of discovery and the ability to work through uncertainty—qualities that may be undermined by excessive AI dependence.
