# The Three Framework Lenses

!!! info "Framework Overview"
    The Symbiotic Intelligence Codex framework maps three inseparable lenses that guide the partnership between humans and artificial intelligence. These three interconnected perspectives form the foundation of effective human-AI collaboration.

## The Three Lenses Explained

  ### Story: Shaping the Query
  
  This lens shapes the query, representing the stance or narrative you adopt toward reality.
  
  **Human Analogue**: Myth, autobiography, and cultural narratives
  
  **AI Analogue**: The explicit prompt used to frame a computation
  
  **Key Practice**: Re-authoring the story to widen the search space, where generative breadth is considered less important than precision at this stage
  
  **Function**: To shape the narrative frame and invite re-authoring

  ### Science/Model: Executing Transformation
  
  This lens executes the transformation of inputs into outputs.
  
  **Human Analogue**: Formal reasoning, engineering methods, and empirical feedback
  
  **AI Analogue**: Model's architecture, weights, and internal "self-prompting"
  
  **Key Practice**: Keeping the model "plastic" through continual fine-tuning, adversarial training, and ensemble reasoning to acknowledge the system's evolving context
  
  **Function**: To surface transparent reasoning

  ### Spirit/Context: Supplying Possibilities
  
  This lens supplies the latent space, which is the complete set of possibilities the engine can sample from.
  
  **Human Analogue**: Felt sense of interconnection, phenomenology, and ecological embeddedness
  
  **AI Analogue**: Windowed context, vector databases, and live data streams
  
  **Key Practice**: Expanding the context without overwhelming the signal, using methods such as progressive disclosure, semantic compression, and privacy scaffolds
  
  **Function**: To track shifting horizons

## The Universal Translator

It is also noted that when these three domains are viewed as a single process, any point can map to any other, effectively functioning as a "Universal Translator".

!!! example "Practical Application"
    When you adjust your prompt (Story), it automatically influences how the model processes information (Science) and what context becomes relevant (Spirit). This triangulation allows for dynamic shifts in perspective that would be impossible with a single-dimensional approach.
