Based on the sources, the Symbiotic Intelligence Codex framework maps three inseparable lenses that guide the partnership between humans and artificial intelligence. These three lenses are:
•
Story: This lens shapes the query, representing the stance or narrative you adopt toward reality. Its human analogue includes myth, autobiography, and cultural narratives. For AI, this corresponds to the explicit prompt used to frame a computation. A key practice associated with this lens is re-authoring the story to widen the search space, where generative breadth is considered less important than precision at this stage. Its function is to shape the narrative frame and invite re-authoring.
•
Science/Model: This lens executes the transformation of inputs into outputs. In humans, it is analogous to formal reasoning, engineering methods, and empirical feedback. For AI, this relates to the model's architecture, weights, and internal "self-prompting". A key practice is to keep the model "plastic" through continual fine-tuning, adversarial training, and ensemble reasoning to acknowledge the system's evolving context. Its function is to surface transparent reasoning.
•
Spirit/Context: This lens supplies the latent space, which is the complete set of possibilities the engine can sample from. Its human analogue involves a felt sense of interconnection, phenomenology, and ecological embeddedness. For AI, this corresponds to concepts like windowed context, vector databases, and live data streams. A key practice is to expand the context without overwhelming the signal, using methods such as progressive disclosure, semantic compression, and privacy scaffolds. Its function is to track shifting horizons.
The sources also note that when these three domains are viewed as a single process, any point can map to any other, effectively functioning as a "Universal Translator".
