Based on the sources, one cognitive amplifying effect of the accelerating human-AI loop is Speed and Throughput.
This is described as perhaps the most immediate benefit of integrating AI into human workflows. It involves the sheer acceleration of problem-solving by combining human direction with AI's fast computation. This allows for more iterations to occur in a given time. For example, in software development, AI coding assistants enable developers to prototype and debug at a much faster pace. A study found that programmers using GitHub Copilot completed a coding task 55% faster on average, meaning tasks that once took hours can sometimes be achieved in minutes. In educational settings, the rapid feedback from AI can reduce the feedback loop from days to virtually instantaneous. A study with an AI tutor showed that students not only improved learning outcomes but did so in less time, learning "more than twice as much in less time" compared to a traditional class. Essentially, faster iteration cycles reduce downtime and help individuals stay in a state of productive flow.
