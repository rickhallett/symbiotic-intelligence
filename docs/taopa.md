## What is this?

**The Art of Personal AI** is a three‑layer framework that fuses psychotherapy, software engineering, and contemplative practice into one map for conscious human‑AI collaboration.

| Layer                 | Components                   | Amplified Quality | One‑line Purpose                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1 · Consciousness** | **Story · Spirit · Science** | Awareness         | Align narrative, meaning, and evidence so the mind stays open rather than reactive. |
| **2 · Sensitivity**   | **Prompt · Context · Model** | Precision         | Tune the conversation (human + machine) for nuance that canned chatbots miss.       |
| **3 · Intelligence**  | **IQ · EQ · AI**             | Capability        | Blend raw cognition, emotional attunement, and algorithmic power into action.       |

The Venn‑diagram above visualises how these triads interlock; the sweet‑spots are where resistance drops and insight accelerates.

## Why it matters

* **Emotional Bottlenecks ≠ Lack of IQ.** Most people stall on hard topics like AI because the limbic system shouts *danger*—not because they lack raw intelligence.
* **Framework → Flow.** By surfacing hidden resistance (psychotherapy) and rewriting the interface (engineering), we turn fear into fluent skill‑building.
* **Scarcity Edge.** Very few practitioners straddle all three domains.
